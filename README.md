# Real-time-Sentiment-Analysis-Dashboard

Project: Real-time Sentiment Analysis Dashboard
Description:
This project involves building a real-time sentiment analysis dashboard that analyzes and visualizes the sentiment of incoming text data (e.g., tweets, news articles). The sentiment analysis will be performed using a pre-trained natural language processing (NLP) model, and the dashboard will display real-time sentiment trends using interactive charts.

Technologies Used:

TypeScript
Node.js (for server-side logic)
Express.js (Node.js framework)
Socket.IO (for real-time communication)
React.js (for frontend)
Chart.js (for data visualization)
Natural Language Processing (NLP) library (e.g., TensorFlow.js, SpaCy)
Project Structure:

server.ts: TypeScript file for server-side logic using Express.js and Socket.IO.
client/: React.js components for frontend development.
client/styles/: CSS stylesheets for styling React components.
client/components/: React components for building the dashboard.
client/pages/: Additional pages if needed (e.g., landing page, about page).


Run the Project:

Make sure you have Node.js and TypeScript installed.
Install necessary dependencies (npm install express socket.io nlp-library for server-side, and npm install react react-dom socket.io-client for client-side).
Compile TypeScript files (tsc server.ts for server and tsc client/App.tsx for client).
Start the server (node server.js) and client (npm start or any other React development server command).
Open your web browser and go to the specified address (e.g., http://localhost:3000) to view the real-time sentiment analysis dashboard.
This project provides a foundation for building a real-time sentiment analysis dashboard using TypeScript, Node.js, and React.js. You can further enhance the project by improving the user interface, adding more sophisticated sentiment analysis models, and integrating additional features such as historical data analysis and user authentication.
